"""Property tests for boundedness (safety) and cooldown/oscillation invariants.

Run: python3 tests/test_boundedness.py

Verifies, over many simulated streams across noise levels and archetypes:
  - Safety: bounded interventions in any budget-reset window never exceed the
    configured budget.
  - Cooldown: a routine never executes twice within its cooldown period.
  - Anti-oscillation: stance transitions within the oscillation window stay at or
    below k+1 (the +1 being the forced entry into COOLDOWN).
