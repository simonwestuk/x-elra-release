"""Policy wrappers: ARL and the three baselines, over a shared interface.

Each policy consumes the same perception stream and produces a list of
``StepResult`` records. The crucial design point is that ARL and the baselines
differ *only* in the regulatory layer:

  ARL  -- full controller: mode hysteresis (dwell + oscillation), budgets,
          cooldowns, mode gating, and a structured decision trace per step.
  B1   -- direct-ML: the (noisy) perception is mapped to a stance every step and
          an intervention is emitted whenever the stance is specialised. No
          hysteresis, no budgets, no cooldowns, no trace (model log only).
  B2   -- rule-based ITS: same per-step stance as B1 (no hysteresis) but with
          per-rule cooldowns, and a rule-fired log (no evaluation path, no
          non-action record, no versioning).
  B3   -- OLM-only: displays learner state, never intervenes (state log only).

Holding perception and recommender fixed isolates the contribution of the
regulatory layer, as the evaluation design requires.
