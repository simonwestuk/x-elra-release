"""Study 2 -- Audit / decision-trace sufficiency (DEMM-style) vs standard logs.

Hypothesis addressed: H4 (audit usability). Following the per-property
reconstructability framing of the Decision Evidence Maturity Model, we ask, for
each decision a system emits, whether an external auditor can reconstruct five
properties from the recorded evidence alone:
  policy_basis   -- which routine/rule (and version) authorised the action;
  decision_basis -- why this action and not a higher-priority one (evaluation path);
  boundary       -- what condition would change the decision (exit conditions);
  non_action     -- why nothing happened at a no-op decision point;
  replay         -- deterministic reconstruction from the recorded inputs.

We report per-property completeness over (a) all decisions and (b) action-only
decisions, plus a localisation task: given an intervention, can the responsible
routine and its suppression context be identified, and how many records must be
inspected to do so (a proxy for time-to-diagnosis).
